Programming Languages
---


### C/C++

* [My Code School](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWliApDc61w&list=PL2_aWCzGMAwLSqGsERZGXGkA5AfMhcknE) - One of the best tutorials to start programming in C. 
* [Books]() - Coming soon!
* [Getting Started With Sport Of Programming](http://sportprogramming.blogspot.in/2014/07/getting-started-with-sport-of.html) - The best set and step by step guide of competitive programming. 


### Python

* [Lynda](https://www.lynda.com/Python-tutorials/Python-3-Essential-Training/62226-2.html) - Getting started with Python 3


### JavaScript

* [udemy](https://www.udemy.com/understand-javascript/) - One of the very few tutorials that teaches Javascript the right way.


### Bash

* [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVt3Rst-2H8&list=PL7B7FA4E693D8E790) - An awesome video series on getting started with shell scripting.

## Linux Or Windows?
* There is no such thing as one is better than the other. 
* If you are working on C#/.NET and building apps for the windows platform then definitely working on windows is better. 
* Default shell in both Linux and Mac uses [Bash](#bash) for scripting.
* Most of the Linux flavours are free and have great community support.
* In Linux, you don't need an anti-virus.
* In windows there are GUI tools available to perform most of the tasks(eg: git push/pull, ssh), so mostly you will not be working in cmd/terminal and also automating a GUI tool is not possible.
* In Linux you don't need GUI tools to perform tasks like ssh, ftp etc.

## Version Control

* [Git](https://www.lynda.com/Git-tutorials/Git-Essential-Training/100222-2.html) - Git is one of the most popular version control softwares.


##FAQs

### Which language should I learn first?
You can start with any one of the above languages(C/C++, Java, JavaScript, Python). Learn the basic syntax, some basic data structures like an array and linked list, and make some small programs like Fibonacci series, factorial etc.
Just start somewhere, don't just keep looking for the best language. Learning a second language will not be difficult.



### I haven't studied computer science in my 11th and 12th. Do I have any disadvantage?
Think of it as a marathon, it's not a sprint. Initially, of course, you have a disadvantage but in the long run, you can defeat others by your consistency. Just start somewhere and work hard.
